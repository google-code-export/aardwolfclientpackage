= GMCP mapper - `aard_GMCP_mapper.xml (also aardmapper.lua)` =

A dynamically updated mapper that enables rapid navigation by storing room information in a SQLite database.

== What does it look like? ==
Probably something like this

== Are there any configuration options? ==
Oh, yeah. Tons of them! See that little box in the top left corner of the mapper that looks like `[*]`? Click on that to bring up a display configuration menu. (Click on the `[x]` to close it again.)

In this menu, all of the items are clickable. If the item is a color, then a color picker dialog will come up. If the item is a number, then a number input dialog will come up. And so on.

== Are there any special commands for using the mapper? ==
Many! To see the entire list, type
{{{
mapper help
}}}

== Where am I on the mapper? ==
Your current position is the room box in the middle with the bold outline in the color specified as "Our room" in the configuration menu.

== Can I right click anywhere? ==
You can right click on any of the rooms currently being displayed. This will bring up a small menu of room-related options.

== How do I get details about a room? ==
If you hover the mouse over any room, you will see a bubble pop up with information about that room.

== I updated to a new version and now when I go out on the continents the mapper looks different. What's going on? ==

Are you confused about this?

Original versions of the package did not yet include the [Bigmap merged Bigmap plugin]. If you absolutely need access to the old gmcp map tiles on the continents (to add notes or change exits by mouse) you can toggle the bigmap view by typing:
{{{
bigmap off
}}}
and
{{{
bigmap on
}}}
