== Are there any configuration options? ==
Oh, yeah. Tons of them! See that little box in the top left corner of the mapper that looks like `[*]`? Click on that to bring up a display configuration menu. (Click on the `[x]` to close it again.)

In this menu, all of the items are clickable. If the item is a color, then a color picker dialog will come up. If the item is a number, then a number input dialog will come up. And so on.
