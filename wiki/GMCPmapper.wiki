= GMCP mapper (`aard_GMCP_mapper.xml` and `aardmapper.lua`) =

A dynamically updated mapper that enables rapid navigation by storing room information in a SQLite database.

== What does it look like? ==
Probably something like this

http://aardwolfclientpackage.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki_images/gmcpmapper.png

== Are there any configuration options? ==
Oh, yeah. Tons of them! See that little box in the top left corner of the mapper that looks like `[*]`? Click on that to bring up a display configuration menu. (Click on the `[x]` to close it again.)

In this menu, all of the items are clickable. If the item is a color, then a color picker dialog will come up. If the item is a number, then a number input dialog will come up. And so on.

== Are there any special commands for using the mapper? ==
Many! To see the entire list, type

== Where am I on the mapper? ==
Your current position is the room box in the middle with the bold outline in the color specified as "Our room" in the configuration menu.

== Can I right click anywhere? ==
You can right click on any of the rooms currently being displayed. This will bring up a small menu of room-related options.

http://aardwolfclientpackage.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki_images/gmcpmapperright.png

== How do I get details about a room? ==
If you hover your mouse over any room, you will see a bubble pop up with information about that room.

http://aardwolfclientpackage.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki_images/gmcpmapperbubble.png

Or if you're in the room you can use the command

{{{
mapper thisroom
}}}

== When I go out on the continents the mapper looks different. What is this? ==

Are you confused about this?

https://aardwolfclientpackage.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki_images/bigmapcompare.png

Original versions of the package did not yet include the ability to show what is called the 'bigmap'. If you need access to the old gmcp map tiles on the continents (to add notes or change exits by mouse) you can toggle the bigmap view either by typing:
{{{
bigmap off
}}}
and
{{{
bigmap on
}}}
or through the right-click menu options
