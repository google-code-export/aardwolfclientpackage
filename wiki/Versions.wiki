#summary How do I know what version I have?

= Someone asked me what version of the package I have. How can I tell? =

Unless you have a very old copy of the package (update! update now!), you should have a file called !AardwolfPackageChanges.txt in your MUSHclient folder. This file lists in order from newest to oldest all of the development snapshot releases that have been made since the first beta release was publicly announced on December 1, 2010.

If you want to make sure to get the best assistance possible, when asking for help with the client be sure to include what "snapshot" version you're using. Your snapshot is the first (newest) entry in the file.

Versions after r768 have a '`checkversion`' alias that will print out the package version for you.

= MUSHclient says the version is 4.72. Why is that not my version? =

The Aardwolf MUSHclient Package is a collection of add-ons to MUSHclient. The Aardwolf MUSHclient Package is developed by Fiendish, but MUSHclient itself is developed by Nick Gammon and has its own release cycle. Whenever a new version of MUSHclient is made available, it gets put into the next release of the Aardwolf package, but the Aardwolf package gets updated far more often than MUSHclient does. So many different releases of the Aardwolf package may contain the same version of MUSHclient.

= I know that plugins have version numbers. Why don't the plugin version numbers change even when I know changes were made? =

Mostly because I'm lazy and forgetful. I don't trust myself to always make sure that plugin version numbers update properly, so I mostly don't bother with them. Maybe I'll change my mind on this later, but if you want to make sure that you have the latest plugins, get the latest package.

= I'm still confused. Can you show me an example? =

Ok...
