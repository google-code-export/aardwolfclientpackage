= MUSHclient Tweaks FAQ =

For the most part, as configured by default, you should be able to just run the program and start playing without any changes. But maybe you want to customize things a little bit to match your taste, and you don't know quite where to look.

== If I want to make configuration changes and triggers and stuff, where do I look? ==

The main configuration area of MUSHclient is accessible through the Game menu. Go to Game->Configure

All of the options under this menu will just bring up different sections of the same world configuration screen.
