#summary aardwolf color functions

= `aardwolf_colors.lua` =

A lua snippet file that provides functions for handling Aardwolf color codes to any plugin that wants to use them.

== What functions does it provide? ==

==== `StylesToColoursOneLine (styles, start_column, end_column)` ====
Converts all or part of a single line of MUSHclient style runs into a string containing Aardwolf color codes, starting at column start_column and ending at column end_column. To convert the entire line use 1 for start_column and some sufficiently high number for end_column like 99999.

==== `ColoursToStyles (text)` ====
The reverse of StylesToColoursOneLine. This takes a string containing Aardwolf color codes and generates a sequence of MUSHclient style runs.

==== `strip_colours (text)` ====
Takes a string containing Aardwolf color codes and removes all of the color codes from it.

== Why do you use both the American and British spellings of "color"? ==
Because screw you, that's why!
