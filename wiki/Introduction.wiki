= Welcome to the Online Guide =

So you've followed the instructions at http://www.aardwolf.com/play/downloadmc.htm and either you downloaded the official quasi-monthly release of the Aardwolf MUSHclient Package, or you've gone to get the latest development snapshot, and now you have a shiny new MUSHclient folder. Congratulations! You're well on your way to an enhanced Aardwolf experience. 

This guide should make the transition a little bit easier for those who have either never used MUSHclient before or who are new to this package.
