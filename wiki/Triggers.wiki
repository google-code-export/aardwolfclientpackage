#summary writing triggers

= How do I write triggers in MUSHclient? =

Scripting is a complicated subject that has been addressed by documentation for MUSHclient itself. See the following pages for help on writing triggers:

= I tried making a trigger but it isn't firing. The pattern is the same as what I use in zMUD. What am I doing wrong? =

In zMUD, if you make a pattern that looks like

{{{
This is a pattern
}}}

It will match on 

{{{
HELLO This is a pattern FROM THE FUTURE!!!
}}}

Because zMUD's standard pattern format is sloppy and begins and ends with implicit `"*"`.

MUSHclient works differently. MUSHclient's standard pattern format treats your pattern as if it begins with `"^"` and ends with `"$"`. There is no implicit allowance for extra garbage outside of the pattern. In MUSHclient if you want to catch

{{{
* This is a pattern *
}}}

Then that is what you must do.
