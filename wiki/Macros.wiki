= How do I make macros in MUSHclient? =
There are two ways of creating macros in MUSHclient, one of them is much more flexible but the other is much easier to use if it fits your needs.

== The easy but inflexible way ==
The simplest way of creating macros is through the Macros configuration dialog. You can find this by pressing
{{{Shift+Control+2}}}
or by using the menu option
{{{Game->Configure->Macros...}}}

There you will find a set of predefined key combinations that you can use for sending various commands to the MUD. You cannot create new key combinations in this dialog, and you cannot process complex scripts.

== The more complex and more powerful way ==
The more flexible way to create macros is through a scripting feature called Accelerators. Accelerators can be made for any key combination and are overall more flexible in what they can do. 

The MUSHclient FAQ has an entry on creating accelerators that you should read here:

Also see the relevant documentation pages:
