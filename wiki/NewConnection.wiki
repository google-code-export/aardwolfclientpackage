= New user welcome dialog and automatic connector - `aard_new_connection.xml` =
A welcome message for new users of the Aardwolf MUSHclient Package that provides a very brief introduction to the client. It also connects to Aardwolf automatically when loading MUSHclient.

== I've forgotten what it said. Can you remind me? ==
This is what the welcome message looks like.

== I'm stuck at the welcome screen. How do I make it go away? ==
Click on the `[x]` in the top right corner.

== This stupid screen shows up every time I launch MUSHclient! Make it go away! ==
This may sound crazy, but did you try reading it? It tells you how.
