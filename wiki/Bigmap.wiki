= `Aardwolf_Bigmap_Graphical.xml` =

Display a graphical view of the continent bigmap. Optionally merge this display with the GMCP mapper window (this is the default behavior).

== What's a bigmap? ==
Back when the continents were created, Lasher decided that it would be nice to give people a way to visually appreciate them better. The 'bigmap' command lets you see the continent that you're currently on. See the in-game help file:
{{{
help bigmap
}}}

== What does this look like? ==
If you happen to be on Mesolar, it will probably look something like this

== Hey, my GMCP mapper got replaced by this bigmap picture. What gives? ==

== How do I change this plugin's behavior? ==
Right click functionality isn't enabled on this one just yet, but there are a few commands for switching between different operation modes.
