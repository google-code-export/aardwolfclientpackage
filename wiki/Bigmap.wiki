#summary bigmap window

= `Aardwolf_Bigmap_Graphical.xml` =

Display a graphical view of the continent bigmap. Optionally merge this display with the GMCP mapper window (this is the default behavior).

== What's a bigmap? ==
Back when the continents were created, Lasher decided that it would be nice to give people a way to visually appreciate them better. The 'bigmap' command lets you see the continent that you're currently on. See the in-game help file:
{{{
help bigmap
}}}

== What does this look like? ==
If you happen to be on Mesolar, it will probably look something like this

== Where am I on the bigmap? ==
You are here:

The inner box shows your current room. The outer border shows the range that you can see on the ASCII overhead map.

== Hey, my GMCP mapper got replaced by this bigmap picture when I walk onto the continents. What gives? ==
That is a major feature of this plugin. If you really don't like it, see below for options to change this behavior.

== Why did you do this? ==
Because before the GMCP mapper looked like this on the continents and had a less than stellar display:

== You idiot, the GMCP map tiles are WAY BETTER on the continents. This bigmap stuff is garbage! ==

You're wrong on so many levels. Here's just one example of why this addition makes sense.

== How do I change this plugin's behavior? / How do I get the standard GMCP mapper tile view back on continents? ==
Right click functionality isn't enabled on this one just yet, but there are a few commands for switching between different operation modes.

== I got a message saying "To activate this continent map, walk onto the continent and type: 'bigmap update'. What does that mean? ==
Before you can see the pretty continent picture like shown above, the plugin has to generate it based on the bigmap information from the game. This is how we do that. Just do what the message says.
