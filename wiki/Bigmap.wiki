#summary bigmap window

= `Aardwolf_Bigmap_Graphical.xml` =

Display a graphical view of the continent bigmap. Optionally merge this display with the GMCP mapper window (this is the default behavior).

== What's a bigmap? ==
Back when the continents were created, Lasher decided that it would be nice to give people a way to visually appreciate them better. The 'bigmap' command lets you see the continent that you're currently on. See the in-game help file:
{{{
help bigmap
}}}

== What does this look like? ==
If you happen to be on Mesolar, it will probably look something like this

== Hey, my GMCP mapper got replaced by this bigmap picture when I walk onto the continents. What gives? ==
That is a major feature of this plugin. If you really don't like it, see below for options to change this behavior.

== How do I change this plugin's behavior? ==
Right click functionality isn't enabled on this one just yet, but there are a few commands for switching between different operation modes.

To get a brief description of the available bigmap commands, type

== I got a message saying "To activate this continent map, walk onto the continent and type: 'bigmap update'. What does that mean? ==
Before you can see the pretty continent picture like shown above, the plugin has to generate it based on the bigmap information from the game. Just do what the message says.
