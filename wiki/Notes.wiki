===In order to make the Chat Capture plugin work...===
you need to first make sure that the Dina font is properly installed (See http://mushclient.com/forum/bbshowpost.php?id=9659). Then download all of the files available under [http://code.google.com/p/aardwolfclientpackage/downloads/list the Downloads tab] and put them where they need to go.

Then you can get the latest version of Chat Capture from http://aardwolfclientpackage.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Aardwolf_Chat_Capture_mw.xml
