  * The situation with resizing miniwindows is bad. I don't want to have to jury rig a second invisible miniwindow that does nothing but stick to the corner of another miniwindow just so I can resize without losing callbacks because it was decided arbitrarily that the callbacks should get erased. The issue has been filed here: http://mushclient.com/forum/?id=10204&page=999
Let's hope that a Resize function gets implemented quickly, because I really don't want to have to work around this one. The right solution is too simple. The workaround is too ugly.
