= Automatic Update Checker (aard_package_update_checker.xml) =

This plugin enables the Aardwolf MUSHclient Package, if you choose, to automatically check for new beta versions from this google code repository every time you launch MUSHclient.

== Enabling update checks ==

The very first time you launch a new copy of the Aardwolf MUSHclient Package you should see this message:

http://aardwolfclientpackage.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki_images/update_check_first_run.png

Choosing `[`Yes`]` will enable update checks. Choosing `[`No`]` will not.

At any time during play you can change your mind as indicated in the message by simple installing or removing the !Aardwolf_Package_Update_Checker plugin (aard_package_update_checker.xml).

== Can I make the update check run more often than once per startup? ==

The plugin has the following built-in command for that:
{{{
package update check
}}}

== How do I know when there is a new version available? ==

If the update checker plugin finds a new update, you will see a message pop up like this one:

http://aardwolfclientpackage.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki_images/update_check_updates.png

=== What happens if I choose `[`Ok, Show Me`]`? ===

Choosing `[`Ok, Show Me`]` will launch your default web browser to this URL which will always allow you to download the newest beta release:

https://code.google.com/p/aardwolfclientpackage/downloads/detail?name=MUSHclient.zip

=== What happens if I choose `[`Ignore`]` or press Esc or just close the message dialog? ===

If you choose to ignore the update message, you will not be informed about updates again until another beta version is released. As a reminder of this policy, you will be shown a message similar to this one:

http://aardwolfclientpackage.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki_images/update_check_ignore.png

== How does it check what version I have? ==

It uses the `AardwolfPackageChanges.txt` file in your MUSHclient directory. Please never modify this file.
