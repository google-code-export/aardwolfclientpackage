= MUSHclient Tweaks / FAQ =

For the most part, as configured by default, you should be able to just run the program and start playing without any changes. But maybe you want to customize things a little bit to match your taste, and you don't know quite where to look.

== If I want to make configuration changes and triggers and stuff, where do I look? ==

The main configuration area of MUSHclient is accessible through the Game menu. Go to Game->Configure

All of the options under this menu will just bring up different sections of the same world configuration screen.

== How do I make it so that commands stay on the input line after I hit enter? ==

Go to Game->Configure->Commands... as shown above.
Then check the box for "Auto-repeat Commands".

== How do I make my keyboard number pad send numbers instead of north/south/east/west/etc? ==

Go to Game->Configure->Keypad... as shown above.
Then uncheck the box for "Enable Keypad Keys".

== How do I change the main output font? ==

Go to Game->Configure->Output... as shown above.
Click on the "Font..." button and choose a new font.

== Can I get rid of that message bubble that shows the line number and date? ==

Absolutely. Go to Game->Configure->Output... as shown above.
Uncheck "Show Line Information".

== Can I make it so that text automatically gets copied to the clipboard when I select it, without having to do Ctrl+C? ==

Yep. Go to Game->Configure->Output... as shown above.
Check "Copy selection to Clipboard".

==== Can I get Aardwolf color codes with that? ====

Nope. Sorry. But see the page on [ColorCopy the included plugin for copying with color codes].

== Can I disable F1 as being the program help macro? ==

Yes, though that's stored in a different place than most configuration settings.
Go to File->Global Preferences... and click on the General tab. Then check the box for "F1, F6 are macros". This will also let you use F1 as your own custom macro if you want.

== Where is the main output scroll bar? I can't find it! ==

[https://code.google.com/p/aardwolfclientpackage/wiki/Layout#Where_is_the_scroll_bar?_I_don%27t_see_it_anymore. See the answer to this question here.]

== I don't like that the input bar automatically resizes. How do I change that? ==

Honestly, I think you're just wrong, and I too thought it looked a bit funny when I first started using it. There are absolutely no down sides to the auto-resizing input bar, only benefits. Please try it for a few days, let yourself get used to it, then come back and thank me.

== Ok, I tried it out for a while and I still hate that the input bar automatically resizes. Yes, I know I'm wrong. ==

As long as you gave it an honest chance, here are all of the things you can do to modify the way the input bar works...

Press Ctrl+I or go to Game->Immediate... and in the window that pops up you can use one or more of the following script commands

Deactivate resizing (1 re-activates it)
{{{
SetOption ("auto_resize_command_window", 0)
}}}
Set the minimum height to, for example, 2 lines (default 1)
{{{
SetOption ("auto_resize_minimum_lines", 2)
}}}
Set the maximum height to, for example, 30 lines (default 20)
{{{
SetOption ("auto_resize_maximum_lines", 30)
}}}
