= Miniwindow Z-order Monitor - `aard_miniwindow_z_order_monitor.xml` =

This plugin handles keeping track of the Z ordering of the miniwindow plugins included in the package and any other plugins that choose to use this ordering system.

=== What is Z-order? ===
See the Wikipedia entry on Z-order here: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Z-order

=== How do I make the included miniwindows change ordering? ===

All of the included miniwindow plugins have the right-click menu options 'Bring to Front' and 'Send to Back'.

=== How do I make my own miniwindow plugins make use of your Z-ordering system? ===
If you want another miniwindow to fit into the Z-order system, there are only a few steps (the following assumes that the name of your miniwindow is stored in a variable called win)...

  * The name of your miniwindow must only contain numbers, letters, and the underscore character. Using the plugin UID as your miniwindow name is fine, for example.
  * After any call to `WindowCreate` and BEFORE you subsequently call `WindowShow`, you need to do
  {{{
  CallPlugin("462b665ecb569efbf261422f", "registerMiniwindow", win)
  }}}
  * You need to have an `OnPluginBroadcast(msg, id, name, text)` function that includes the following
  {{{
  if (id == "462b665ecb569efbf261422f" and msg==996 and text == "re-register z") then
    CallPlugin("462b665ecb569efbf261422f", "registerMiniwindow", win)
  end
  }}}
  * You need to add this section of code (or if you already have an `OnPluginListChanged` function, you need to work this code in).
  {{{
  first_check = false
  require "checkplugin"
  function OnPluginListChanged()
    if not first_check then
        do_plugin_check_now("462b665ecb569efbf261422f", "aard_miniwindow_z_order_monitor") -- check we have z order plugin
        first_check = true
        OnPluginInstall() -- run install again now that the z order plugin is loaded
    end
  end -- OnPluginListChanged
  }}}

  * Once all of that is done, you can bring your miniwindow to the front of the stack by calling:
  {{{
  CallPlugin("462b665ecb569efbf261422f","boostMe", win)
  }}}
  and drop it to the back by calling:
  {{{
  CallPlugin("462b665ecb569efbf261422f","dropMe", win)
  }}}
  How you choose to do that is up to you, but I recommend adding a right-click `WindowMenu` with 'Bring to Front' and 'Send to Back' options.
