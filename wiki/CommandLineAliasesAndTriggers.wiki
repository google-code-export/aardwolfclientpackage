= How do I add aliases and triggers from the command line like I can in `<other_client>`? =

MUSHclient does not by default have a mechanism for creating aliases and triggers from the command line. This is likely because of a combination of the possible complexity of setting up any given alias or trigger and the fact that more and more people are moving towards using plugins for everything. 

But the fact remains that sometimes a player wants to be able to set up simple aliases and triggers quickly and easily without dealing with the rather complicated interface and without having to write a full plugin. 

It is possible to add this functionality to MUSHclient by adding two aliases:
{{{
#alias {*} {*}
}}}
for adding new simple aliases, and
{{{
#trigger {*} {*}
}}}
for adding new simple triggers.

The process for adding these is as follows:

  1. Select all of the text in the box below and copy it
{{{
<aliases>
  <alias
   match="#alias {*} {*}"
   enabled="y"
   group="special_convenience_aliases"
   send_to="12"
   sequence="100"
  >
  <send>require "addxml"  -- addxml extension

-- add the alias

addxml.alias {  
  match = "%1", 
  send = "%2",
  sequence = 100,
  enabled = true,
  send_to = 10,
  group = "command_line_aliases"
             }

ColourNote ("white", "green", "Added alias to match on '%1', sending '%2'")
  </send>
  </alias>

  <alias
   match="#trigger {*} {*}"
   enabled="y"
   group="special_convenience_aliases"
   send_to="12"
   sequence="100"
  >
  <send>require "addxml"  -- addxml extension

-- add the trigger 

addxml.trigger {
  match = "%1", 
  send = "%2",
  sequence = 100,
  enabled = true,
  group = "command_line_triggers"
               }

ColourNote ("white", "green", "Added trigger to match on '%1', sending '%2'")
  </send>
  </alias>
</aliases>
}}}

  2. Go back to MUSHclient and bring up the Aliases configuration screen by pressing Shift+Ctrl+9 or going to Game->Configure->Aliases... as shown here:

  3. On the Aliases configuration screen, find the Paste button and click it:

You should now have both aliases in place. Click OK to go back to the game.
