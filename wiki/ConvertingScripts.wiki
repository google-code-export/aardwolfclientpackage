= How do I easily convert all my scripts to work in MUSHclient? =

Easily? Well it's not necessarily that simple. 

Very basic aliases and triggers should be relatively easy to transfer over using the information outlined in [CommandLineAliasesAndTriggers How do I add aliases and triggers from the command line like I can in <other_client>?]

But for anything complex, or for anything that makes use of special client interfaces, you're going to have to go through the process of learning what is called the API or application programming interface of MUSHclient. See the [Triggers Writing Triggers] and [Aliases Writing Aliases] pages for guidance.

You may find it useful to head on over the [http://www.mushclient.com/forum/?bbsection_id=1 MUSHclient forums], where people are usually very willing to offer detailed assistance.
