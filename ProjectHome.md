A comment on licensing...<br>
The plugin building community surrounding MUSHclient is one based on helping and sharing whenever possible. People ask questions about how to do things and are frequently provided answers in the form of large blocks of code with no discussion of copyright. People copy and paste and reuse and extend and then sometimes they give back and sometimes they attribute. But nobody demands that they give back, and few if any demand attribution. Nobody gets upset if someone doesn't include a license file, because nobody has assigned terms for redistribution. They just give. This, in my mind, is the spirit of sharing embodied by civil implicit acceptance of the <a href='http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/'>WTFPL</a> under a strong moral code of sharing. Unless otherwise specified, documents contained in this repository are all individually covered by the <a href='http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/'>WTFPL v2</a> with the added encouragement that sharing is good for everyone.<br>
